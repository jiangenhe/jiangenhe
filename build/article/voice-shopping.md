Many e-retailers are beginning to offer artificially intelligent virtual assistants on their websites (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Domino's DRU assist), allowing consumers to place an order by speaking, texting, or clicking. We propose that engaging in voice-based interactions will encourage consumers to purchase more recommended products as opposed to the other response modalities. Voice-based interactions carry more social functions than text- and click-based interactions, and this social inclination evokes people’s anthropomorphism tendencies. As a result, consumers are more likely to comply with a recommendation to purchase products. This effect is only observed in two-way dialogues, in which consumers obtain social responses from the computer reciprocally, but not in one-way monologues, where a social response from the computer is missing. Five studies using an online food-ordering website are conducted to test the hypotheses.

We developed different interfaces to examine the role of both the consumer’s and the computer’s modalities during the interaction process.
